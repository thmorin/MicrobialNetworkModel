Butyrate- + 2*H2O -> 2*acetate- + H+ + 2H2
does H2O need to be accounted for when adjusting from free energy of formation to corrected free energy?

trying to represent the anabolic and catabolic reactions. strugglign with the anabolic side. what represents biomass with Gibbs free energy of formation?
