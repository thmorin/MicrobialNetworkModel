CONCEPTS
implicit numerical methods (ideally - may not be possible)
what sort of time step is reasonable? daily or hourly are the most common 'fine' data. half hourly sometimes available. even those are maybe too large in many cases

WHAT I'D LIKE TO INCORPORATE
clapeyron - phase change
richards - water flow
	van genuchten - water retention curve
fourier's law - thermal transfer
monod kinetics - microbial kinetics empirically based on michaelis menten kinetics, which are for enzymetic
phase changes - particulate, dissolved, sorbed, biomass. residue? unclear what this is to me. dead microbes?
advection dispersion of compounds
manning's flow
snow redistribution model (based on roughness) - plants trap some snow - increase roughness perhaps
bubble formation and transport - consider all volatile species. compare to atmospheric pressure and maybe a roughness coefficient. allow it to re-equilibrate as it goes up


WHAT I NEED BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO YET
plants - my weakest area. i don't yet know how to approach this
	root distribution
	leaf distribution
	stresses from o2, h2o, nutrients, etc?
	movement of water
	carbon cycle
multiple carbon forms
	carbohydrates
	monomers
	co2
	ch4
	acetate
	proteins
	plant materials
		lingin?
		xylem?
		cellulose?
		tannin?
		cutin?
		what are roots made of?
	there must be a bajillion others in here. are they important?


IMPORTANT BGC
iron
manganese
sulfur
nitrogen


there need to be boundary conditions for everything - most important immediate concerns - water and energy boundary conditions
